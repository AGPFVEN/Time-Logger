# To do later (not prioritary)

# Doing
- Projects view
- DB Pooling (Create a pool of db connections)

# Meanwhile:
    #DB Testing
        To test the db use:

        docker exec -i pg psql -U app -d appdb < database/tests/01-rows.sql

        Then explore the db to see if changes applied (I use the postgres vscode extension)
            localhost
            app
            secret
